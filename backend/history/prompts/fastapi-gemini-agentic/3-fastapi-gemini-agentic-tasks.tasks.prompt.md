# Response

Successfully created comprehensive task breakdown for the FastAPI backend refactoring to use OpenAI Agent SDK with Gemini API. The tasks include:

- 42 individual tasks organized by 8 phases
- Clear user story organization with independent test criteria
- Proper checklist format with Task IDs, parallelization markers, and user story labels
- Dependencies and parallel execution examples documented
- MVP scope identified (Phases 1-3) for incremental delivery
- Backward compatibility maintained while enhancing functionality

The tasks are ready for implementation, starting with foundational setup and progressing through user stories in priority order. Each user story is designed to be independently testable and deliverable as a complete increment.
